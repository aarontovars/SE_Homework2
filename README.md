# Software Engineering Homework 2

This repository contains the exercises solved of Homework 2 from the course Software Engineering in the 1st semester of MAIA program.

## Exercise 1
The program will prompt the user to choose the operation choice (from 1 to 5). Then it asks the user to input two integer vales for the calculation.

## Exercise 2
The program will display the smallest and greatest of those values. It also displays the value that occurs the most.

## Exercise 3
By using two-dimensional array, write C++ program to display a table that represents a Pascal triangle of any size.

## Exercise 4
By using C++ pointer, find the max of an integral data set. The user inputs the number of data values in the set and each value. Then the max of the data set is shown.

## Exercise 5
The five values will be stored in an array using a pointer. Then print the elements of the array on the screen.

## Exercise 6
The function will accept two arguments: a pointer that points to the array and the array size. The function returns a pointer that points to the sorted array.
